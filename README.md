# CodeCard
Application for the Oracle Code Card

These applications are designed to run on the Oracle Code Card board which uses an ESP8266 and 2.7" ePaper display.

See: https://developer.oracle.com/codecard/

Given the slow refresh rate of the ePaper display, most of the applications tend to lend themselves to screens that require infrequent screen changes such as clocks, news stories, and stock updates.
